IPTV Server
This is a Node.js server code that generates an IPTV playlist file based on the channels extracted from a web page. The generated playlist file can be used to stream video content from various channels.

Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:

express: A web application framework for Node.js
cheerio: A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery for server-side HTML manipulation
connect-timeout: A middleware for setting a timeout for incoming HTTP requests
fs: The file system module for interacting with the file system
axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests
path: A module for working with file paths in Node.js
These dependencies can be installed using npm or yarn package manager.

Installation
To install the dependencies and run the server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the code files.
Install the dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
Run the server using npm start or yarn start.
The server will listen on the specified port (or default port 3000) and generate an IPTV playlist file at the specified file path (or default file path "./iptv.m3u").

Usage
Endpoints
The server exposes the following endpoints:

/online: Returns a "online" response when accessed, indicating that the server is running.
/: Generates an IPTV playlist file based on the channels extracted from a web page and serves it as a download when accessed.
Functions
The server code includes the following functions:

extractChannels($: CheerioAPI): Extracts channels from a web page using Cheerio, a server-side HTML manipulation library. It returns an array of Channel objects containing the channel name and URL.
generateFile(channels: Channel[]): Promise<string>: Generates an IPTV playlist file based on the extracted channels. It takes an array of Channel objects as input and appends the channel information to the playlist file using the fs module. It returns a promise that resolves to a string indicating the file creation status.
Data Structures
The server code includes the following data structures:

Channel: An interface representing a channel with properties name (string) and url (string). Channels are extracted from the web page and stored as an array of Channel objects.
Configuration
The server code includes the following configuration variables:

target: The URL of the web page from which channels are extracted.
filePath: The file path of the generated IPTV playlist file.
host: The host URL used to construct the complete URL of each channel.
port: The port on which the server listens.
These configuration variables can be adjusted to customize the behavior of the server.
